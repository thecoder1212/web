    <h4 class = "subhead"> Two digit squares</h4>
    <p class = "para">
It is standard knowledge than an equation <br/> (ab)^2 <br/> is expanded to the form a^2+2ab+b^2, therefore, when squaring a number the formula a^2 + 2ab + 2c gives the correct answer of the square and it allows a person to compute a square much faster (as compared to traditional mathematics). <br/> Take for example the number 63. <br/> 
60^2=3600, 60*3*2=360, 3^2 = 9. 3600+360+9=3969. This method will always work for numbers under 100 (see spreadsheet).
<h4 class = "subhead2"> Three squares</h4>
<p class = "para2"> For three digit squares, let's assume that the digits of the number can be represented by the variables a,b,c. These variables will hold the value of each digit, the face value of the digits rather than the place value. These variables can be used to solve three digit squares by putting them in the formula <br/>
(ab^2)*10+2c(ab)+c^2 <br/>
As the spreadsheet below will prove, this formula will work for every single positive three digit integer (it also works on four digit integers but I haven't evaluated the extent of it).
